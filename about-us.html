We structure information to match common search intents: someone looking for "cinema Brossard" or "brossard multiplex cinema" is typically planning a visit and needs practical, verifiable guidance rather than promotional material.</p>

<p>We prioritize clarity and accessibility in our HTML structure, using semantic elements, ARIA labels where appropriate, and ensuring content is readable without JavaScript. Tables include responsive containers for small screens, and accordions use native HTML <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> elements for progressive disclosure.</p>

<p>Content is reviewed periodically to ensure it reflects common visitor questions and aligns with publicly available information about cinema operations in Quebec. We do not publish real-time data, but we do update guidance when broader patterns or policies change in the Canadian cinema industry.</p>
